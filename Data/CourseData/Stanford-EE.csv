The seminar will consist of a series of lectures. The first part of each lecture will focus on the different design aspects of an engineering project, including formation of the design team, developing a project statement, generating design ideas and specifications, finalizing the design, and reporting the outcome. Students will form teams to follow these procedures in designing a term project of their choice over the quarter. The second part of each lecture will consist of outside speakers, including founders of some of the most exciting companies in Silicon Valley, who will share their experiences about engineering design. On-site visits to Silicon Valley companies to showcase their design processes will also be part of the course. The seminar serves three purposes: (1) it introduces students to the design process of turning an idea into a final design, (2) it presents the different functions that people play in a project, and (3) it gives students a chance to consider what role in a project would be best suited to their interests and skills.",,,,,

Drexler's thesis sparked the imagination of what nano machinery might do, whereas Crichton's popular novel channeled the public's attention to this subject by portraying a disastrous scenario of a technology gone astray.

This year's focus on evolving cloud computing architectures and their impact on the enterprise; big data trends and rise of the third platform; software as a service; wireless and cellular network architectures; mobility and mobile data proliferation; open mobile platforms (e.g. Android); multi-homed mobile networking, associated data communication and mobile resource trade-offs, and system implementation in smartphones and Android devices.",,,,,
Stanford,EE,EE 392K,Big Data and Learning Systems for Large-Scale Networks,Win,3,"The course will consider data from sensors in large-scale networks such as Cloud Computing Systems and the Internet of Moving Things. Methods for sensing, denoising the sensed data, and reconstructing the evolution of the network in fine detail from snapshot observations will be discussed. Techniques for synchronizing clocks across a large data center, and using machine learning to perform real-time inference at scale will be presented. The principles of creating an interactive database for detecting anomalies, raising alerts, and serving insights to the user will be discussed. The course will involve a team-based project. Required prerequisites: basic computer networks as in  CS 144 or  CS 244. Recommended: basic statistics or machine learning, as in  EE 278 or  CS 229.",,,,,
