02-223,Personalized Medicine: Understanding Your Own Genome,Fall,9,"Do you want to know how to discover the tendencies hidden in your genome? Since the first draft of a human genome sequence became available at the start of this century, the cost of genome sequencing has decreased dramatically. Personal genome sequencing will likely become a routine part of medical exams for patients for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Personal genome information will also play an increasing role in lifestyle choices, as people take into account their own genetic tendencies. Commercial services such as 23andMe have already taken first steps in this direction. Computational methods for mining large-scale genome data are being developed to unravel the genetic basis of diseases and assist doctors in clinics. This course introduces students to biological, computational, and ethical issues concerning use of personal genome information in health maintenance, medical practice, biomedical research, and policymaking. We focus on practical issues, using individual genome sequences (such as that of Nobel prize winner James Watson) and other population-level genome data. Without requiring any background in biology or CS, we begin with an overview of topics from genetics, molecular biology, stats, and machine learning relevant to the modern personal genome era. We then cover scientific issues such as how to discover your genetic ancestry and how to learn from genomes about migration and evolution of human populations. We discuss medical aspects such as how to predict whether you will develop diseases such as diabetes based on your own genome, how to discover disease-causing genetic mutations, and how genetic information can be used to recommend clinical treatments."

02-750,Automation of Biological Research: Robotics and Machine Learning,Fall,12,"Biology is increasingly becoming a ""big data"" science, as biomedical research has been revolutionized by automated methods for generating large amounts of data on diverse biological processes. Integration of data from many types of experiments is required to construct detailed, predictive models of cell, tissue or organism behaviors, and the complexity of the systems suggests that these models need to be constructed automatically. This requires iterative cycles of acquisition, analysis, modeling, and experimental design, since it is not feasible to do all possible biological experiments. This course will cover a range of automated biological research methods and a range of computational methods for automating the acquisition and interpretation of the data (especially active learning, proactive learning, compressed sensing and model structure learning). Grading will be based on class participation, homeworks, and a final project. The course is designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students with a wide variety of backgrounds. The course is intended to be self-contained but students may need to do some additional work to gain fluency in core concepts. Students should have a basic knowledge of biology, statistics, and programming.Prerequisites: 10-601 or 10-701Course Website: https://sites.google.com/site/automationofbiologicalresearch/?pli=1"

15-150,Principles of Functional Programming,Fall and Spring,10,"An introduction to programming based on a ""functional"" model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs?that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

15-410,Operating System Design and Implementation,Fall and Spring,15,"Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and ""team programming"" skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.

15-412,Operating System Practicum,Fall,0,"The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the real world.  Groups of two to four students will select, build, install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project; and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.  Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or to extend a 15-410 student kernel.  In some situations students may work alone.  Group membership and unit count (9 units versus 12) will be decided by the third week of the semester.  Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging in some mixture of messy, potentially open-ended activities such as: learning a revision control system, writing a short design document, creating and updating a simple project plan, participating in an informal code review, synthesizing scattered information about hardware and software, classifying and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people over a long period of time, etc.Prerequisite: 15-410"

Teams will give presentations and deliver documents on topics such as:          risk management          project planning          requirements          architecture          detailed design          quality assurance          final product presentations          reflections on the experience  Evaluation will be based on the in-class presentations, process and project documentation, how well the teams follow software engineering (SE) practices, and the client's satisfaction with the product. Individual grades will be influenced by peer reviews, individual reflection documents, mentor impressions, and presentation performance. Students will leave the course with a firsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that drive SE practices, will have concrete experience with these practices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this experience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to support immediate competency in a software engineering organization, along with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the new processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace."

Networks have also changed dramatically: from the 300-baud dialup modems of the early networking era to gigabit LANs, Wi-Fi and 4G today.    Who knows what changes are in store for us over the next half century?  Astonishingly, in spite of this tremendous change in hardware technology over time,  a small core set of techniques for building distributed systems has emerged and remained surprisingly stable and applicable across many system layers.    Many flavors of these  techniques exist, and they continously evolve over time to reflect changing trade-offs in the design space.  What are these core techniques, and how can we leverage them in creating distributed systems today and in the future?     That is the central question addressed by this course.

The topics covered will include  basic parallel algorithms  for sequences (e.g., mapping, reductions), trees  (e.g., tree  contraction), and graphs (graph search, connectivity, graph  contraction)  as well as scheduling algorithms (e.g., work stealing)   for mapping parallel computation to hardware for optimal efficiency  and performance.   There will be one midterm, several assignments  (involving programming),  and one project; the project will account for  50% of the grade.      ** Project Ideas **     The project can be theoretical or practical.  The ideal project would  be one that  adds parallelism to the students' current research. For  example, if the student  does research in a field such as  algorithms/graphics/robotics and he or she can   design/analyze/implement a parallel algorithm (possibly for an open  problem);  if the student does research on a field such as programming  languages or databases,  she or he can design/implement language/query  support for parallelism; if the  student does research on machine  learning, he or she can develop a framework  for performing approximate  inference in parallel.   Projects can be done individually or in groups   and will lead to a small paper.

05-341,Organizational Communication,All Semesters,9,"Most of management is communication. You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, coordinate activity, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify communication challenges within work groups and organizations and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. The intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly participate in when you move to a work environment, and strategies for improving communication within your groups. Because technology is changing communication patterns and outcomes both in organizations and more broadly in society, the course examines these technological changes. Readings come primarily from the empirical research literature. Course Website: http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/courses/organizational-communication"

05-395,Applications of Cognitive Science,Spring,9,"The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.

05-432,Personalized Online Learning,Fall,12,"Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.

05-434,Machine Learning in Practice,Fall and Spring,12,"Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.

The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization."
11-364,An Introduction to Knowledge-Based Deep Learning and Socratic Coaches,Spring,12,"The subject of this course will be deep learning, one of the most dynamic and exciting emerging areas of computer science.  Deep learning deals with and is conquering the problems resulting from the enormous quantity of data that now surrounds us.  Furthermore, the course will explore knowledge-based deep learning, a new methodology invented by the instructor that offers many potential advantages over conventional deep learning. This is a learn-by-doing, team-project based course, which will be divided into four phases.  In phase one, each student will read and present a number of papers describing state-of-the-art deep learning systems and successful applications.  In phase two, each team will implement the system described in one of the papers.  In phase three, each team will scale that implementation to one of the large benchmark datasets.  In phase four, each team will do a special research project implementing a knowledge-based deep learning system based on pending patent applications of Professor Baker. As a potential follow-on for successful projects, students may participate in a summer course on entrepreneurial applications of deep learning or work as interns in a bootstrap startup based on the knowledge-based deep learning projects.

This field is called Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics, and it is extremely multidisciplinary. This course will therefore include some ideas central to Machine Learning and to Linguistics.  We'll cover computational treatments of words, sounds, sentences, meanings, and conversations. We'll see how probabilities and real-world text data can help. We'll see how different levels interact in state-of-the-art approaches to applications like translation and information extraction.

11-661,Language and Statistics,Fall,12,"Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this century's information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory prob&stats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of ""Language and Statistics"" is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipf's distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

10-605,Machine Learning with Large Datasets,Spring,12,"Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.

10-807,Topics in Deep Learning,Fall,12,"Building intelligent machines that are capable of extracting meaningful representations from high-dimensional data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks. In the past few years, researchers across many different communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep (hierarchical) models ?models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception.  This is an advanced graduate course, designed for Master's and Ph.D. level students, and will assume a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the recent and exciting developments of various deep learning methods. Some topics to be covered include: restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their multi-layer extensions Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann machines; sparse coding, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and attention-based models with applications in vision, NLP, and multimodal learning. We will also address mathematical issues, focusing on efficient large-scale optimization methods for inference and learning, as well as training density models with intractable partition functions.

16-161,ROB Freshman Seminar: Artificial Intelligence and Humanity,Fall and Spring,9,"In 1965 British mathematician I.J. Good wrote, An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.  As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence."
16-223,Introduction to Physical Computing,Fall,10,"Physical computing refers to the design and construction of physical systems that use a mix of software and hardware to sense and respond to the surrounding world.  Such systems blend digital and physical processes into toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, and more.  This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities.  The course is organized around a series of practical hands-on exercises which introduce the fundamentals of circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing, simple mechanisms, actuation, and time-based behavior.  The key objective is gaining an intuitive understanding of how information and energy move between the physical, electronic, and computational domains to create a desired behavior.  The exercises provide building blocks for collaborative projects which utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider how to make things, but also for whom we design, and why the making is worthwhile.  This course is an IDeATe Portal Course for entry into either of the IDeATe Intelligent Environments or Physical Computing programs.

17-619,Introduction to Real-Time Software and Systems,Intermittent,12,"Introduction to Real-Time Software and Systems presents an overview of time as it relates engineering complex systems. Any system that responds at the pace of relevant events has real-time constraints whether the timescale is short, like the flight controls for an aircraft, or longer, like the flight reservation system for an airline.  Fundamental concepts, terminology, and issues of real-time systems are introduced in this course. The focus is on software solutions to real-time problems-solutions that must be both correct and timely. Software development is examined with emphasis on real-time issues during each phase of the software lifecycle. Real-time requirements analysis, architecting real-time systems, designing and modeling system timing, and implementation and testing strategies are studied. Modeling techniques using UML 2.0 are applied. Particular emphasis is placed on real-time scheduling to achieve desired timing, reliability, and robustness. Languages and operating systems for real-time computing, and real-time problems in concurrent and distributed systems are explored.  This course provides a comprehensive view of real-time systems with theory, techniques and methods for the practitioner. After successfully completing this course, the student will be able to identify constraints and understand real-time issues in system development, and propose approaches to typical real-time problems.

Familiarity with software engineering concepts and system development lifecycle."
17-628,The Modern CIO,Fall,6,"In today's competitive marketplace, technology can deliver the decisive edge as a company interfaces with its existing customers, engages prospective clients, and communicates across internal, local, national and global channels.  Chief Information Officers of successful companies must possess skills that reach beyond the technical realm.   Research indicates that competence in the areas of business acumen, communication, financial knowledge, project and board management far surpasses the need for technical competence.     This course focuses on the non-technical aspects of  'the corner office'.   If the CTO is to be a true strategic business partner with others in the C-suite (CEO, COO, CFO), it is essential that he or she has a grasp not only on technology, but also on the company's core philosophy, business strategy and drivers.     This course will capitalize on the technical knowledge acquired in the Master of Software Engineering Professional Programs, and using it to target high-level job opportunities."
17-635,Software Measurement,Fall,9,"Sections D and PP are NOT available for on-campus students.

Examples of such domains include robotics, avionics, automotive, process control, and many others. Students successfully completing this course will be better prepared to communicate with hardware-oriented engineers, understand the hardware environment, and the subtle regions where software and hardware meet.   Requirement: Students need not have a hardware background, but they should have a solid computer science background including languages, data structures, discrete math, operating systems, and computer organization.  It is highly desirable that students have project experience, preferably real-world experience, although project course work and/or internships will suffice. Undergraduates need instructor approval (lattanze@cs.cmu.edu)."
17-648,Engineering Data Intensive Scalable Systems,Intermittent,12,"Internet services companies such as Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, and Facebook have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance.  These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways.  They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.  Class size will be limited."
17-651,Models of Software Systems,Fall,12,"Scientific foundations for software engineering depend on the use of precise, abstract models for describing and reasoning about properties of software systems. This course considers a variety of standard models for representing sequential and concurrent systems, such as state machines, algebras, and traces. It shows how different logics can be used to specify properties of systems, such as functional correctness, deadlock freedom, and internal consistency. Concepts such as compositionality, abstraction, invariants, non-determinism, and inductive definitions are recurrent themes throughout the course. After completing this course, students will:  1. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of certain models and logics including state machines, algebraic and process models, and temporal logic;  2.

17-664,Enterprise Application Integration,Intermittent,12,"Modern business enterprises are supported by hundreds of disparate applications that work together to achieve a common goal. These applications are typically large three-tier (or n-tier) application silos developed to support a particular facet of business. Unfortunately, in most cases these systems were never designed to have their services reused transparently across an organization. The result is often a lack of flexibility for large-scale reuse, lack of reliability when integrated, inappropriate security models for organization-level integration, and others.  Enterprise Application Integration is a graduate-level course on how to design and deploy large-scale systems for supporting the critical backbone of an organization. Although a particular emphasis is put on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), a broad set of topics is covered. These include security for large-enterprise systems, reliability for distributed long-running transactions, standards for intra- and extra-organization system integration, deployment and fault-tolerance of systems, and others. The aim of the course is to prepare future software architects to pragmatically deal with large-scale systems, so as to understand the trade-offs and implications of supporting the goals of an organization.  PP section for Portugal students only."
