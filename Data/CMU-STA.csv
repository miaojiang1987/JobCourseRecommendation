36-149,Statistics Freshman Seminar,Fall and Spring,9,"Networks: Where do they come from? What do they tell us? Thirty years ago, the word ""network"" was mostly used in reference to computers or television broadcasting channels. Now we have networks of friends, enemies, phones, stars, tweets, international governments, terrorists, etc. Where do these networks come from? How are they built? What do they represent? As we learn more about how everything is connected, we also face challenges in trying to understand the data that a network can generate. In this course, you'll learn about networks from a New England monastery facing a political crisis to social groups of friends (is obesity contagious? what about divorce?) to 15th century marriages among prominent Italian families to international political disputes and skirmishes (is the enemy of my enemy my friend?) to the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users. Along the way, we'll explore how to describe, visualize, analyze, and even break down the networks that surround us.",,
